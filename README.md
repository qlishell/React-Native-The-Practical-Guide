## Initial Structure

To get started with this project, we'll use Expo. Open a terminal and run the following command inside a directory of your choice:

```bash
expo init rn-project-structure
```

Alternatively, you can use `create-expo-app` to set up a new Expo and React Native project:

```bash
yarn create expo-app --template blank AwesomeProject
cd AwesomeProject
yarn expo start
```

For more details on creating Expo projects, check out the [create-expo-app documentation](https://docs.expo.dev/more/create-expo/).

## Project Structure

Breaking down your project into manageable layers can help maintain a clean and organized codebase. Here is a common structure you can use:

### 1. **UI or Presentation Layer**

This layer includes all the components and UI elements that the user interacts with. It covers elements like buttons, text, popups, and other visual components.

### 2. **Logic Layer**

The Logic Layer handles the core business logic of your application. It manages all the events, interactions, and operations that take place between the UI and the API layers.

### 3. **API Layer**

The API Layer is responsible for communication with back-end services. It handles API calls to servers or external web services and processes responses to be used by the Logic Layer.

## Folder Structure Example

Hereâ€™s a suggested folder structure for a React Native project:

```
/AwesomeProject
|--/assets
|--/components
|    /Button
|    /Header
|--/screens
|    /Home
|    /Details
|--/services
|    /api
|--/utils
|--/hooks
|--/context
|  App.js
|  app.json
|  package.json
```

-   **/assets**: Contains static assets like images and fonts.
-   **/components**: Reusable UI components.
-   **/screens**: Different screens or views in the application.
-   **/services**: API services and utilities.
-   **/utils**: Utility functions and helpers.
-   **/hooks**: Custom React hooks.
-   **/context**: React context providers and state management.

## Best Practices

-   **Modularity**: Keep components small and focused on a single responsibility.
-   **Separation of Concerns**: Maintain a clear separation between UI, business logic, and API interactions.
-   **Reusability**: Create reusable components and hooks to reduce code duplication.
-   **Consistent Naming**: Use consistent naming conventions for files and folders to enhance readability.

By following these best practices, you'll create a well-organized and maintainable React Native project. Happy coding!
